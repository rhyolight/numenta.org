How the brain creates intelligence is viewed by many as the greatest scientific
quest of all time. We are living at the time when rapid progress is being made
and a comprehensive theory of brain function is emerging. Jeff Hawkins, an
inventor, engineer, neuroscientist, author and entrepreneur, presents the big
picture of what we know so far and describes recent progress in a core issue:
why neurons are arranged as they are in the neocortex, how this arrangement
builds models of the world, and how these models make predictions and generate
actions.

Series: "UC Berkeley Graduate Council Lectures".
