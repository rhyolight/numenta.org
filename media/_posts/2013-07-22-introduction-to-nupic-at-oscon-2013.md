In this hands-on session, we introduce NuPIC's Online Prediction Framework (OPF)
and demonstrate how one creates models using an OPF client. We set up some live
streaming data to pass into the client and watch as NuPIC makes online
inferences, learning the changing patterns in the streaming data set. NuPIC and
the OPF have been applied to many scenarios and form the foundation for
Numenta's commercial product, Grok. To master NuPIC you will have to become
comfortable with concepts such as sparse distributed representations and on-line
learning.
