title: Modeling Data Streams Using Sparse Distributed Representations

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNMbsvK8Q8Y" rel="prettyPhoto">Modeling Data Streams Using Sparse Distributed Representations</a>.

In this screencast, Jeff Hawkins narrates the presentation he gave at a workshop
called "From Data to Knowledge: Machine-Learning with Real-time and Streaming
Applications." The workshop was held May 7-11, 2012 at the University of
California, Berkeley.

Sparse distributed representations appear to be the means by which brains encode
information. They have several advantageous properties including the ability to
encode semantic meaning. We have created a distributed memory system for
learning sequences of sparse distribute representations. In addition we have
created a means of encoding structured and unstructured data into sparse
distributed representations. The resulting memory system learns in an on-line
fashion making it suitable for high velocity data streams. We are currently
applying it to commercially valuable data streams for prediction,
classification, and anomaly detection In this talk I will describe this
distributed memory system and illustrate how it can be used to build models and
make predictions from data streams.
