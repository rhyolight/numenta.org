title: Building Brains to Understand the World's Data

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y43qwS8fl4" rel="prettyPhoto">Building Brains to Understand the World's Data</a>.

The neocortex works on principles that are fundamentally different than
traditional computers. In this talk I will describe recent advances in
understanding the neocortex and how we are applying them to model millions of
high velocity data streams.

The talk will start with a description of sparse distributed representations,
which are the fundamental units of information in brains. I will then discuss
how these representations are learned and how the brain processes them to build
predictive models from sensory data. Numenta has built a product called Grok
that emulates these capabilities of the neocortex. Grok is being used to
understand high velocity machine generated data in many different domains. I
will give a brief introduction to Grok and speculate on the future of machine
intelligence.
