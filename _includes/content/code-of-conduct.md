# Numenta Code of Conduct

### Event Anti-Harassment Policy

Numenta is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religious
preferences. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including
talks and Hackathon demos. Event participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the
event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, or religious preferences, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by t-shirts with the word
“root” on the back.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local
law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
