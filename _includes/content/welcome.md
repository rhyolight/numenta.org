  Open Source Platform and Community for Machine Intelligence based on
  <abbr title="Hierarchical Temporal Memory">HTM</abbr> Theory
</p>

**NuPIC** is an open source project based on a theory of neocortex called
**Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)**. Parts of HTM theory have been
implemented, tested, and used in applications, and other parts of HTM theory are
still being developed. Today the HTM code in NuPIC can be used to analyze
streaming data. It learns the time-based patterns in data, predicts future
values, and detects anomalies. NuPIC includes discussion groups on HTM theory,
research on extending HTM, and source code for complete applications based on
HTM. We welcome participation in all of these areas.
