# Licenses

## Summary

Our core algorithms are [AGPL Version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html), buy there are ways you can experiment with our technology without being constrained. We offer both a [commercial license option](mailto:sales@numenta.com?subject=Commercial%20License%20Inquiry) (more details soon) and a [trial license](trial/), which allows you to experiment temporarily without affecting your codebase with the AGPL, giving you time to decide whether a commercial license is worth it.

* <i></i> NuPIC and associated applications of NuPIC at <http://github.com/numenta> are licensed as dual commercial and [AGPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)
* <i></i> Commercial licenses are also available from [Numenta](mailto:sales@numenta.org).

The goal of the license is to require that enhancements to NuPIC be released to the community.
