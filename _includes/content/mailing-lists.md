# NuPIC Mailing Lists

## [\[nupic-discuss\]](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic_lists.numenta.org)

This is our general mailing list, for discussions about NuPIC installation, usage, bug reports or any other topic that doesn't have to do with NuPIC development or theory.

This is a friendly list where newcomers can come and ask questions about how things work (or should work). If you are just getting started with NuPIC and you want help becoming productive, this is your list.

## [\[nupic-theory\]](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic-theory_lists.numenta.org)

Are you interested in discussing the theory behind HTM? Subscribe to this list!

### Posting Guidelines

This is a list for discussing theoretical aspects of HTM theory.  It is not a list for general discussions of AI and machine learning. There are other good groups for non-HTM discussions like comp.ai.neural-nets and comp.ai.philosophy.

Here are some examples of appropriate topics and examples of topics that are best discussed elsewhere.

#### Appropriate:
- Mathematical analysis or empirical results of HTM theory
- Theoretical extensions of HTM theory
- Biological findings that relate to HTM theory

#### Inappropriate:
- Proposals for alternate approaches to machine intelligence
- Extensions to HTMs that are not biologically plausible
- AI or neural network theories that are not based on SDRs, temporal
memory, pooling, and hierarchy
- Detailed questions about NuPIC and HTM implementations - those should go to
\[nupic-discuss\]

For example: a discussion of using SDRs and HTM temporal memory for
natural language processing is an appropriate topic, but a general
discussion of language theory is not.

Another example: a discussion of how to extend HTM to incorporate
goal-oriented behavior is appropriate, but general discussions of
robotics is not.

## [\[nupic-hackers\]](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic-hackers_lists.numenta.org)

This list is for people interested in working on the NuPIC software project. Discussions on this list include:

- new features
- bug fix proposals
- implementation discussions
- future direction of the NuPIC project

This list is probably too much for someone who just wants to *use* NuPIC.

Anything goes, no moderation. Star Trek, neuroscience, cat pictures, whatever.
