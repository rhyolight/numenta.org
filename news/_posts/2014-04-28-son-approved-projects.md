title: 2014 Season of NuPIC Approved Projects
---

Sometime in the mid-March, we announced [Season of NuPIC](http://numenta.org/son/).
This is first such event for the NuPIC community and we're very happy with the
quality of proposals and the projects we've approved. There were a bunch of
interesting proposals and ideas that were submitted by hackers across the world.
The NuPIC community selected the best seven proposals for this edition of Season
of NuPIC. The selected project roster has interesting proposals like
["Benchmarking and Visualizing HTMs"](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/SoN-2014-Projects#benchmarking-and-visualizing-htms),
["Epilepsy Seizure Prediction"](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/SoN-2014-Projects#epilepsy-seizure-prediction) and
[many more](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/SoN-2014-Projects).

The NuPIC community would like to congratulate all the selected participants and
wish them luck. Also the community would like to thank all the mentors who have
volunteered to help with SoN.
