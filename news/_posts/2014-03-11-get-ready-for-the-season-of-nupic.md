title: Get Ready for the Season of NuPIC
---

[Season of NuPIC]({{ site.baseurl }}/son) (SoN) was proposed as a cool way for
students to participate actively in NuPIC related projects, similar to
[Google's Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/) (GSoC). The idea is to
conform to a similar format as GSoC, where Numenta is the mentoring
organization. Interested parties do not have to be students in order to
participate but do have to make a reasonable time commitment. Numenta will pair
up students with mentors for accepted projects, so it's a great way to learn
more about NuPIC and contribute at the same time.
