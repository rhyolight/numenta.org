Numenta is offering a half-day technical workshop to provide training for
developers or potential customers/partners interested in our technology.
Workshop sessions will review Numenta theory, technology, and applications â€“ and
provide an overview for how to get started on your own projects using Numenta
technology. The majority of content will be technical in nature and is intended
for a developer/technical audience. Training curriculum will be followed by a
networking reception.
