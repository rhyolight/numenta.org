title: Sensory-motor Integration in HTM Theory, by Jeff Hawkins
---

[RSVP on Meetup.com!](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/168671932/)

The neocortex generates most of our high level behavior and every region in the
neocortex has some form of motor output.  In this talk I will describe what we
know about how the cortex generates behavior and how behavior fits within the
framework of Hierarchical Temporal Memory theory.  Although we donâ€™t yet have a
comprehensive theory of how the neocortex generates behavior we do understand
several of the major components giving us hope that a comprehensive theory may
be reachable in the near future.

This event will be recorded and live-streamed.
