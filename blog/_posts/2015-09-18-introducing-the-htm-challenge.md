title: Introducing the Numenta HTM Challenge
---

Numenta has held [five](http://numenta.org/blog/2013/06/25/hackathon-outcome.html) [hackathons](http://numenta.org/blog/2013/11/06/2013-fall-hackathon-outcome.html) over the [past](http://numenta.org/blog/2014/05/09/2014-spring-hackathon-outcome.html) [several](http://numenta.org/blog/2014/10/30/2014-fall-hackathon-outcome.html) [years](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDpDhDZvixTUubv9R9cpZK4T) to engage our [community]({{site.baseurl}}/#community) of dedicated and passionate HTM enthusiasts. Overall, this has been a great time for me and lots of others involved. We've grown together and created some really interesting things!

The one consistent complaint I've gotten from hackathon attendees is that there just _wasn't enough time_ to complete their projects. We've been listening to you...

**_So it's time to up the ante!_**

### The Challenge

[![{{ page.title }} Image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image }})](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/)

The [Numenta HTM Challenge](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/) is an online contest that starts **_today_** and runs util November 14th. Participants must come up with ideas for real-world applications of HTM technology and submit them for approval before starting work. This ensures the problem you're trying to solve is applicable to HTM, and that the data being analyzed is adequate for HTM. Once your project has been approved, you'll have until November 6th to work on it and submit a demo video for judging (_that's 49 days from today!_).

### Onsite Event Nov 14

**This Challenge can be completed _entirely_ online**, but we encourage you to try to attend the [Onsite Event](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/) that culminates the Challenge on November 14 in Redwood City, California. At this Onsite Event, all demonstration videos will be viewed by a judging panel and a live audience. Judges will get a chance to comment and ask questions to submission authors (either live or over the phone). At the end of the event, we'll announce the winners and cash prizes will be awarded!

In addition to judging, there will also be at least two educational sessions by Numenta team members **Subutai Ahmad** and **Jeff Hawkins**. They will be talking about the history and evolution of HTM algorithms and some details about new algorithm development, respectively.

**You don't have to participate in the Challenge to attend the Onsite Event!** Maybe you just want to come see the latest presentations from Numenta or watch the Challenge demonstration judging. That's great! We welcome you to mingle with us HTM enthusiasts.

### Community Meetup Nov 13

And as long as you'll be in the area, there is a [Community Event](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711563/) being planned on the Friday before the Onsite Event. I hope you'll attend just to **meet the rest of the HTM community**. This event is run _by_ the NuPIC community, _for_ the NuPIC community. A schedule is in the works.

### Help us build the future of Machine Intelligence!

We believe that HTM is the future of machine intelligence. This is a great chance for you to **get involved** and help us move this important technology forward. I hope you'll consider being a part of this event in some way.
