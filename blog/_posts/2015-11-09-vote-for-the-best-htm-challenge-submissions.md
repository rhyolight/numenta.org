## [People's Choice](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions/)

There are 12 submissions at <http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions/> ready for voting. To vote, simply click on a submission, watch the demo video, and -- if you like it -- click the big green "Vote for this project!" button at the top right of the page. You may vote for as many submissions as you like. 

## [Innovation](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HTMInnovation)

Two submissions are in a [special category for innovation](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/updates/4305-new-prize-for-innovation). This may be particularly relevant to our community, because this stuff has an impact on HTM research and development! To vote for one of the two innovation prizes, [**please go to this survey**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HTMInnovation) (after watching the demo videos below) and vote:

- [Column Swarm Reinforcement Learning (CSRL)](http://devpost.com/software/column-swarm-reinforcement-learning)
- [ComportexViz, but for NuPIC](http://devpost.com/software/comportexviz-but-for-nupic)

## Voice Your Opinion

Go forth and vote for your favorite submissions! The prizes for the categories above will be awarded at this Saturday's [HTM Challenge Onsite Event](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/) (which you should RSVP for if you are coming). 

**_Good luck to all the submissions!_**
