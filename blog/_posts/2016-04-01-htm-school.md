**[HTM School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqhsFQzwUC9V8MeeVOQ7eZ9)** is a new YouTube series I am producing to educate the general public about Hierarchical Temporal Memory. It is focused on the layperson, not the expert, so episodes will start off very basic and build up in complexity as the topical areas are populated. Each episode will be bite-sized at 10-15 minutes and dive into a particular topic of HTM theory.

The plan is to progress through all the major concepts of HTM, including SDRs, spatial pooling, and temporal memory. If the series turns out to be popular, I'll keep the episodes coming. If you want to see more, please like the video and [subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-ttzWLgXZOGuhUyrPlUuA)!

Stay tuned for the next episode, where I'll talk about bit arrays. This will be an introduction to _sparse distributed representations_, the next topic in the series. I will probably do several episodes on SDRs!
