title: 2013 Fall Hackathon Outcome
---

Last weekend's hackathon was a lot of fun. Thanks to everyone for coming out. We
gave several educational presentations and held some working sessions. The
participation from the attendees was outstanding.

Thanks again to [Tagged](http://about.tagged.com), who generously donated some
of their workspace to us for the event. The Tagged offices are very cool, and
in a great part of San Francisco.

We had over 50 people attend the hackathon from across the United States and
Europe, most of whom stuck around for the demos after the 30-hour hack period.
In all, we had [7 impressive demos](#demos)! Only a couple were
*natural language processing* hacks, but that's okay. It was great to see
NuPIC users making their ideas a reality in whichever direction they chose to
apply it.

### Feedback

Here's what some attendees had to say on our

[mailing list](http://lists.numenta.org/mailman/listinfo/nupic_lists.numenta.org)
about the hackathon:

> "It was easily the best hackathon I have attended this year."
> - *Jeff Fohl*

> "There was fantastic energy in the room, something that only reinforced my
> sense that Numenta is on to something really big."
> - *Johann Schleier-Smith*

> - *Venkat Venkataraju*

> "Great event, convinced to jump in and start experimenting. Numenta seems to
> be going in the right direction."
> - *Brian Eppert*

> "Great experience. Intelligent people, insightful talks. I was totally new to
> NuPIC and although I didn't complete a project, I feel like I've learned a lot
> about the technology and the whole approach."
> - *Nikolay Samusik*

> "I think we had a nice mix of people at the event, e.g. from those focused on
> neuroscience biological aspects, to those just getting their feet wet, a few

We tried to record everything we could, which included all the sessions (minus
one because of a technical glitch). My apologies for the poor audio and video in
some of these. We had a wireless microphone failure because of unanticipated RF
interference. We attempted to live-stream everything on YouTube via Google
Hangout, which meant we sacrificed quality. For future hackathons, I plan to
have better tools in place.

> Most of the changes on our senses are due, wholly or in part, to our own actions. Therefore, the neocortex learns a sensory-motor model of the world. In this talk, Jeff discussed some of what we know about how the neocortex generates behavior and how we might construct a simple sensory-motor system based on the Cortical Learning Algorithm. It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to add motor output to the CLA.

    <p>Matt compiled and ran NuPIC on a Raspberry Pi, and wired up some wheels, a controller, and light-sensitive sensors to help drive it. While he programmed it to continuously steer towards the brightest light source, he used NuPIC's anomaly scores of the light input from right and left to stop the vehicle when it wandered into unexpected territory.</p>

    <p>This hack intends to give the CLA an ability to evaluate hypothetical input. Imagine that you want to assess (predict) what the consequences of some action (input) would be. You may have a set of possible inputs (as alternatives), and want to evaluate which would lead to the best (predicted) outcome. The demonstration will include mice, a maze, and some cheese.</p>

    <p>This team taught the CLA to learn to control a quadcopter. Their objective was to pilot the quadcopter by controlling its vertical speed to fly to a desired altitude and hover there. The supervised learning approach involved having the CLA watch an expert flyer and learn those sequences, and use its prediction of those sequences to directly control the copter in the face of noise.</p>

    <p>Subutai used the word SDR association framework defined in <a href="http://github.com/rhyolight/nupic_nlp">nupic_nlp</a> to associate three word phrases, teaching it sentences like "elephants eat leaves", "dogs like sleep", and "cows eat grass". After some training, Subutai asks NuPIC, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE">What does the fox eat?</a>" Find out the answer by watching the video!</p>

Lastly, our CEO and Chairman of the Grok/Numenta Board, Donna Dubinsky, said
[a few inspirational words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XjYXFRIAQ&amp;start=8506)
at the end of the hackathon. Thanks, Donna!

This was a really fun event to plan, and it emphasizes what a great community we
have with NuPIC. Thank you everyone, for helping make this open source project
what it is today. I am looking forward to planning our next hackathon this
Spring!
