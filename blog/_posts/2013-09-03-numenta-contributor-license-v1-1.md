title: Numenta Contributor License V1.1
---

We have made two small changes to our
[Contributor License]({{ site.baseurl }}/licenses/cl), regarding GitHub
Usernames and Patent License changes, detailed below.

### Github Username Required

The new version of the CL now requires a Github username, which is necessary in
any case for potential contributors to submit changes to our codebase or
documentation.

### Patent License Change

A member of our community brought up a concern, so we've added a short
clarification to Section 3 regarding grants of patent license.

> **3. Grant of Patent License.** <br/>
> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
> Numenta and to recipients of software distributed by Numenta a perpetual,
> worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
> stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
> import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
> those patent claims <span style="background-color:yellow">existing as of the
> effective date of this CLA and</span> licensable by You that exist at the
> time of the signing of this agreement and are necessarily infringed by Your
> Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work
> to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
> litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
> counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to
> which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
> infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
> Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
> litigation is filed.

This addition bounds the rights of Numenta, preventing us from exercising a
royalty-free license to any patents a contributor creates in the future
unassociated with the NuPIC project.

### Your Options

If you have already signed the CL, and you are comfortable with the document
you've signed, you don't need to do anything. If you would like, you may
[sign V1.1 of the CL]({{ site.baseurl }}/licenses/cl), which will supersede any
existing version on file with us. Once I receive the latest version of the
signed document, I will overwrite any existing CL you've submitted.
