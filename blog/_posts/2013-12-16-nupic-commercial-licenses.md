We created the
[NuPIC open source environment]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.url.index }})
with the desire to build a broad community to work on these algorithms, to
advance the science, and to build applications that can integrate the technology
into people's lives.  We imagined academic work as well as commercial work, both
open source and proprietary.  We chose the
[GPLv3 license]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.url.licenses }}) as a way to
achieve these goals.  In our GPLv3 license, you do not have to pay any license
fee to get started.  If you create something that you'd like to distribute, then
you are required to make this source code available.  This is a great option for
academics and members of the open source community, but in some cases will not
be appropriate for a commercial application.  In the cases where a developer has
created something that they would like to keep proprietary, we are willing to
enter into a commercial license at that time.  The good news is that one can
start on the GPLv3 license, then transition to a commercial license later. <a href="#agpl">*</a>

So, here is how our licensing impacts you if your goal is commercial deployment:

* <i></i> You can get going today at no cost.  You can experiment all you want.
  You can create an application.

* <i></i> As you get ready to launch your application, you will have two
  choices. **First**, you can distribute it under the GPL, which requires that
  you release source code.  This option can work for commercial deployments if
  you have other value-added products or services that you can charge for, such
  as support or integration services, or product modules that are not based on
  the open source.  **Alternatively**, you can request a commercial license
  from us, which would allow you to create a proprietary product. <a href="#agpl">*</a>

I realize you might want to know the terms of that commercial license now,
rather than wait.  But, the truth is, we don't have such a commercial license
today.  We are committed to creating one, but it must be driven by the needs of
the developers, rather than created as an abstract thought process.  Once we
have a real deployment to consider, then we can craft a license that is
appropriate.

You might ask, but can't we just require something unreasonable at that time?
How can you trust us?  Well, all I can say about this is that it is in our best
interests to negotiate a reasonable license.  It does us no good to license
people who fail.  We want to license people who succeed.  As such, our interests
are entirely aligned.   Once you know what product you're creating, the target
market, the price point, the potential volumes, etc., we can work with you to
put together a license that makes sense for both of us.

I feel this structure can work well for the independent developer.  You have no
out-of-pocket up-front costs or commitments, so you can work on your ideas with
little risk.  Once you have something that you think is exciting, you have the
freedom to explore multiple business models.  If at that point, the proprietary
business model is best for your goals, you will have enough info to share with
us so that together we can create an appropriate license.

<small id="agpl" class="disclaimer">* Since this original blog post, we have updated our license to the <a href="http://numenta.org/blog/2015-08-14-agpl">AGPL Version 3.0</a>.</small>
